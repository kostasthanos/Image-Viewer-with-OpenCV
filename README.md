# Image-Viewer-with-OpenCV
This a simple image viewer using OpenCV library and color tracking.

## Main Idea
The main idea of this project is that any user having a folder with image files in it can run the script and watch the images one by one using hand+color movement  and trackig in order to view the next image each time.

There are two basic python files in this project.
1. *rename.py*
2. *image_viewer.py*

## *rename.py*
This file contains the code required to rename all the images in the main folder. If we have a folder containing for example 5 image files, then when we run *rename.py* all of the image files are being renamed to the form *pic+number_of_image+.+extension* (e.g. pic2.jpg)
